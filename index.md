The internet has become a <b>bloated mess</b>. Huge JavaScript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

When popular website like [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) are **[multiple MB in size](/assets/images/nytimes-report.pdf)** (nearly 50% of which is JavaScript!), you know there's a problem. Why does any site need to be that huge? It's crazy.

But we can make a difference - all it takes is some optimisation. Do you really need that extra piece of JavaScript? Does your WordPress site need a theme that adds lots of functionality you're never going to use? Are those huge custom fonts really needed? Are your images optimised for the web?

**The 512KB Club** is a collection of performance-focused web pages from across the Internet. To qualify your website must satisfy **both** of the following requirements:

1. It must be an actual site that contains a reasonable amount of information, not just a couple of links on a page ([more info here](/faq/#lightweight-notice)).
2. Your total UNCOMPRESSED web resources must not exceed 512KB.
