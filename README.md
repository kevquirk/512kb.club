# 512KB Club

The internet has become a **bloated mess**. Massive JavaScript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

When online newspapers like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk) are **over 4MB in size**, you know there's a problem. Why does an online newspaper need to be over 4MB in size? It's crazy.

But we can make a difference - all it takes is some optimisation. Do you really need that extra piece of JavaScript? Does your WordPress site need a theme that adds lots of functionality you're never going to use? Are those huge custom fonts really needed? Are your images optimised for the web?

**The 512KB Club** is a collection of performance-focused web pages from across the Internet. To qualify your website must satisfy **both** of the following requirements:

1. It must be an actual site that contains a reasonable amount of information, not just a couple of links on a page ([more info here](https://512kb.club/#lightweight-notice)).
2. Your total UNCOMPRESSED web resources must not exceed 512KB.

## How to create a PR to add your site to the 512KB Club

1. Fork this repository.
2. Get the **UNCOMPRESSED** size of your website's homepage.
    1. Do a <a target="_blank" href="https://gtmetrix.com">GTMetrix scan</a> on your website.
    2. Once complete, click on the **Waterfall** tab to make sure the **uncompressed** size of your site is less than 512KB.
3. Navigate to [`_data/sites.yml`](./_data/sites.yml) and add your site (template below).
4.  **When creating the PR, please include a link to the GT Metrix results in the PR comment.**
